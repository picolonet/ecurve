Libff notes:
1. G1 curve:
   libff/algebra/curves/mnt753/mnt4753/mnt4753_g1.cpp


Coding Plan:

1. Implemtn G1, G2 and

3. Implement G1Array::Sum routine and debug against reference implementation.

G1Array :
   class that holds an array of (x,y) points. These are points on the curve. Read as input.

   Exposes a routine for "sum". Possibly other helper routines.
   Same class can use MNT4 or MNT6.

   Routine to convert between affine and jacobian.

G24Array :
   Class that holds an array of (x,y) points. Each of x and y are elements of the Fq2 field with coeffients x_a0 and
   x_a1, y_a0 and y_a1.

   Exposes a routine for "sum". Possibly other helper routines.
   We will use this only for MNT4.

   Routine to convert between affine and jacobian.

G26Array :
   Class that holds an array of (x,y) points. Each of x and y are elements of the Fq3 field with coeffients x_a0,
   x_a1, x_a2 and y_a0, y_a1, y_a2. Only for MNT6

   Exposes a routine for "sum". Possibly other helper routines.

   Routine to convert between affine and jacobian.


libff notes:
    fp.hpp contains code for the single q arithmetic (bigint).
    libff/algebra/fields/fp.tcc
    ./libff/algebra/curves/mnt753/mnt4753/mnt4753_init.cpp

./libff/algebra/curves/mnt753/mnt4753/mnt4753_init.cpp:    typedef bigint<mnt4753_q_limbs> bigint_q;

These are defined in: ./libff/algebra/curves/mnt/mnt4/mnt4_init.hpp
mnt4_Fq:
typedef Fp_model<mnt4_q_limbs, mnt4_modulus_q> mnt4_Fq; 

mnt4_Fq2:
typedef Fp2_model<mnt4_q_limbs, mnt4_modulus_q> mnt4_Fq2;


Fp_model:
./libff/algebra/fields/fp.hpp 

Fp2_model:
./libff/algebra/fields/fp2.hpp

The short aliases such as Fq etc are typedefed in:
libff/algebra/curves/public_params.hpp

Bigint:
libff/algebra/fields/bigint.hpp

G1_zero: defined in  ./libff/algebra/curves/mnt/mnt4/mnt4_init.cpp
