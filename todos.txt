TODOs:

1. get rid of redundant modulus constant passing to kernel that is not
   used.
2. Get rid of additional array passing a[]. replace with lane 
   variable, check TODO in myfq.cu.


G1 fq Plan:

1. Kernel routine to copy the data over to the GPU.
2. Jacobian sum and double routines.
3. Reduction to affine.

Possible performance improvements:

1. In myfq.cu: mul by const, look at the fast version that is not working. Also from p2_mul.cu, try a 64 bit version of dev_mul_by_const.
